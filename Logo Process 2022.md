# Logo Process

## Phase 1
Send an email to the client with the questions to better understand their business, requirements and ideas concerning their brand identity.
## Phase 2
Following the client’s requirements, research, experiment and sketch different ideas, layouts, and styles.
## Phase 3
Show your options to the team and choose the best logo samples together. Save them in a PDF file and send to client by email (up to 3 samples). The logos should be presented on a white background and reversed on colored background. Also, you can send different color palettes. (This can be in phase 4 after the client has chosen the logo concept and shape.) Make sure to mention that these are samples and not final. Also, in the email or in the PDF, you must mention the concept and style used so the client can better understand the reason of your design.
## Phase 4
Get feedback from client and finalize the chosen logo. Choose brand fonts* (up to 3 fonts mainly) and color* palettes (primary and secondary pantone colors). If the client has not yet chosen the colors, you can resend an email with different options, and finalize afterwards.
The main logo should be presented on white background, logo reversed on colored background, logo black (one color), and logo horizontal (justified left). Also, mention the fonts used with examples (Title, subtitle, body text) and color palettes with code number, pantone number, and CMYK.

***Fonts:  Body texts are preferably chosen from Google fonts https://fonts.google.com/**

***Colors:  Preferable to choose pantone colors.**

## Phase 5: Saving
Save logo presentation document as PDF file (RGB) and make sure the logo and illustrations are outlined as a vector. When saving, preserve illustrator editing capabilities, so that the client is able to edit. The presentation steps should be in the following order: 
1.	Logo
1.	Logo variations
1.	Typography
1.	Color Palette
1.	Logo Mockups and examples
1.	Marketing Materials 
1.	Etc…
In addition, save the primary logo as a PNG or JPG file with dimensions 1080 x 1080 px

## Phase 6: Delivery
Send the zipped folder with all the files to the client by email.
